# PythonGoogleDinosaurAI
This project was sorta inspired/assisted by [ivanseidel's IAMDinosaur project](https://github.com/ivanseidel/IAMDinosaur). However, I have not been able to replicate his results. I'm expecting this project to end up differing greatly from his algorithm because using his algorithm I ended up with early convergence at score 150ish. Also, to make training easier this project runs in its own window (so you can minimize it) or you can even just have it run in the background without a window (using pyvirtualdisplay).
